## Project Overview

### Introduction:
The "New York Taxi Trips (2017-2018) Analysis" project aims to explore and analyze taxi trip data from New York City spanning the years 2017 to 2018. New York City's taxi services are a vital component of its transportation system, and analyzing trip data provides valuable insights into travel patterns, demand trends, and other factors influencing transportation dynamics within the city.

For this project, you’ll be playing the role of a new Data Analyst for the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. It's your first week on the job, and you just received the following email from the Lead Dispatcher:

Welcome to the team!

This a Project Analysis and Visualization challenge!
We’ve been collecting trip data for ~4 years now, but without a proper analyst we haven’t been able to put it to good use. That's where you come in!

### Objectives:
The raw data has some issues, so we'll need to make the following adjustments and assumptions to clean and prep the data:
- Let’s stick to trips that were NOT sent via “store and forward”
- I’m only interested in street-hailed trips paid by card or cash, with a standard rate
- We can remove any trips with dates before 2017 or after 2020, along with any trips with pickups or drop-offs into unknown zones
- Let’s assume any trips with no recorded passengers had 1 passenger
- If a pickup date/time is AFTER the drop-off date/time, let’s swap them
- We can remove trips lasting longer than a day, and any trips which show both a distance and fare amount of 0
- If you notice any records where the fare, taxes, and surcharges are ALL negative, please make them positive
- For any trips that have a fare amount but have a trip distance of 0, calculate the distance this way: (Fare amount - 2.5) / 2.5
- For any trips that have a trip distance but have a fare amount of 0, calculate the fare amount this way: 2.5 + (trip distance x 2.5)

Once the data is cleaned up, I’m hoping you can build me a dashboard to help with weekly planning and logistics. For any given fiscal week, I'd like to be able to use historical data to answer the following questions:

1. What's the average number of trips we can expect this week?
2. What's the average fare per trip we expect to collect?
3. What's the average distance traveled per trip?
4. How do we expect trip volume to change, relative to last week?
5. Which days of the week and times of the day will be busiest?
6. What will likely be the most popular pick-up and drop-off locations?

Genrate your own insights to add to this!

And of course i added more questions to the objective:
7. What is the Total Revenue in this analysis?                                                                                                            
8. What is the Taxi Trip Trend and Revenue Trend for 2017?                                                                                
9. What is the Taxi Trip Trend and Revenue Trend for 2018?                                                                               
10. What is the total trips by Vendor?                                                                                                                               
11. What is the total trips by payment type?                                                                                                                 
12. What is the total trips by borough?                                                                                                                          
13. Where are the Top 6 Trips zones?                                                                                                                                
14. What is the number of trips by the days of the week?                                                                                        
15. What is the number of trips by the time of the day?   


I realize this is a lot to ask for, but this type of analysis will have a huge impact on our business!
Thanks in advance,

For this challenge, your task is to build a dashboard that meets the requirements.
